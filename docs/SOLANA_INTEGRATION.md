# Solana Integration - Current Status

> **Status:** Infrastructure prepared, health check functional, USDC transfers ready for implementation

## What Actually Works

âœ… **Solana Devnet Connection:** Health check returns `{"result": "ok"}`
âœ… **RPC Integration:** n8n connects to `https://api.devnet.solana.com` 
âœ… **Basic Infrastructure:** Docker + n8n + Solana communication established

## What's Prepared (Not Connected)

ðŸ”§ **USDC Test Infrastructure:** Wallets and tokens created in Solana Playground
ðŸ”§ **Smart Contract Code:** Anchor programs written and tested
ðŸ”§ **Token Setup:** SPL-Token patterns established

## Implementation Gap

**Current:** Health check only
**Needed:** Connect existing USDC infrastructure to n8n workflow

**Estimated time:** 2-4 hours of integration work

## Next Steps

1. Export private keys from Solana Playground
2. Configure n8n Solana credentials
3. Replace health check with USDC transfer
4. Test with small amounts

**The foundation exists - integration work needed, not technical capability.**
